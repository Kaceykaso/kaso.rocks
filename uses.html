		    <h3>What does Kacey use everyday?</h3>
		    <ul class="keyvalue">
			    <li><h4>["computer", ["Apple Mackbook Pro", "Apple Macbook Air"]]</h4>
					<p>I have always had a <a href="#">Macbook Pro</a> by my side, even back when they were called <a href="#">Powerbooks</a>. I currently have a <a href="#">13" M2 Macbook Air</a>, which I admit is a departure, but honestly feels like a Macbook Pro at this point. Its snappy, powerful (runs Baulder's Gate III), and small and lightweight. It's the most portable workhorse out there today.</p>
				</li>
			    <li><h4>["monitor", "Dell Ultrawide"]</h4>
					<p>For the last few years, I have been using Dell monitors, and always try to have a 27" or a couple of 24" monitors. Last year I upgraded to a <a href="#">Dell Ultrawide curved monitor</a> and have been really happy with it. It feels more ergonomic and requires less head turning than two separate monitors, and obviously is pretty nice for gaming.</p>
				</li>
			    <li><h4>["keyboard", ["8BitDo Retro", "Ducky One3 RGB TKL"]]</h4>
					<p>I currently have two keyboards; I usually have a few, but I regularly (everyday) use these two: <a href="#">8BitDo Retro Keyboard</a> and <a href="https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/One3-RGB-TKL-PureWhite">Ducky One RGB TKL keyboard</a>. I'm a big fan of tenkyless keyboards, and both of these are.</p>
				    <ul>
					    <li>The 8BitDo Retro looks fantastic - I'm a big NES fan - and it feels great typing. It's one of the few mechanical keyboards I can type on almost as fast a a low-profile chiclet keyboard (<a href="#">Apple's</a> used to be my go-to).</li>
					    <li>The Ducky One RGB TKL has awesome RGB lighting, which I appreciate more at night, and typically is what I switch to when I'm gaming in the evenings. I also really like the customizable keycaps and key switches, so I was able to really dial every preference when I ordered this keyboard.</li>
				    </ul>
			    </li>
				<li><h4>["camera", "Logitech 1080p HD Webcam"]</h4>
					<p>I use a <a href="#">Logitech 1080p HD Webcam</a>, which at this point seems like the standard for basic video meetings like Zoom. I believe this is my third version of this same camera, for well over a decade.</p>
				</li>
			    <li><h4>["microphone", "Blue Yeti"]</h4>
					<p>For microphone, I've been using a <a href="#">Blue Yeti USB mic</a> for over a decade; well before we all started working from home and taking meetings, I used this mic in podcasting. I'm a big fan of <a href="#">Blue microphones</a>, and using a decaded mic rather than a headset with a mic. They sound better, kinda look better, and I personally do not like big can over-the-ear headphones.</p>
				</li>
			    <li><h4>["headphones", "Apple Airpods"]</h4>
					<p>For headphones, I've been using <a href="#">Apple Airpods</a> for the last 4 years, and <a href="#">wired Apple headphones</a> before that. Yea, I prefer in-ear headphones, and ideally WITHOUT the plungers that seal them in your ear. I realize I'm a weirdo who has always found the basic Apple wired in-ear headphones to be the most comfortable, and since I'm not jogging around, just sitting at my desk most of the time, I find the Airpods to be fantastic.</p>
				</li>
			    <li><h4>["desk", "Jarvis Standing Desk"]</h4>
					<p>My desk for the last 8 years has been a Jarvis standing desk. I used to really like these, but in the last couple of years, my desk has started to have issues with periodically NOT raising or responding at all. Support is quicky to help if you submit a ticket, but having to do that once a year feels bad. So honestly, I'm on the fence in terms of recommending, and I haven't looked into who might be better in motorized standing desks today.</p>
				</li>
			    <li><h4>["chair", "Herman Miller Embody"]</h4>
					<p>My chair is a <a href="#">Herman Miller Embody</a>, which is very pricey - all Herman Miller chairs are. But, much like a mattress, you spend a LOT of time sitting in your desk chair; you certainly shouldn't skimp or cheap-out here. Whether or not it makes sense to go up to a Herman Miller, that's up to you; but I can highly recommend both the <a href="#">Aeron</a> and <a href="#">Embody</a> chairs.</p>
